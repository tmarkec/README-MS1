List of bugs and how did you fix them

## Deployment
This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Creating an app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Create a database 
- Log into [CIdatabase maker](https://www.heroku.com/](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/))
- add your email address in input field and submit the form
- open database link in your email
- paste dabase URL in your DATABASE_URL variable in env.py file and in Heroku config vars

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- Head back over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and click on your **app** and then go to the **Settings tab**
- On the **settings page** scroll down to the **config vars** section and enter the **DATABASE_URL** which you will set equal to the elephantSQL URL, create **Secret key** this can be anything,
**CLOUDINARY_URL** this will be set to your cloudinary url and finally **Port** which will be set to 8000.
- Then scroll to the top and go to the **deploy tab** and go down to the **Deployment method** section and select **Github** and then sign into your account.
- Below that in the **search for a repository to connect to** search box enter the name of your repository that you created on **GitHub** and click **connect**
- Once it has been connected scroll down to the **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy branch** when it has deployed you will see a **view app** button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
- Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.
